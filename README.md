# Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python

A classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the player plays against the computer. The program keeps track of the player's score.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Download `rock paper scissor.py`.
3. Run the program from the terminal using the command: `python "rock paper scissor.py"`
4. Choose rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.

## What I Learned / Concepts Demonstrated
* Using the `random` module (`random.choice`) for the computer's choice.
* Handling user input and converting to lowercase (`.lower()`).
* Lists to store possible choices (`choices`).
* `while` loop to allow the game to continue until the player chooses to stop.
* Complex `if/elif/else` statements to determine the winner based on game rules.
* Score tracking (`score`).
* Asking the user if they want to view the score and play again.
